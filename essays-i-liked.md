# Some essays I liked

Chronologically ordered. I curated these without a specific theme; I found them compelling, and some are moving.

1. A Cautious Case for Socialism; Kenneth J. Arrow; [Dissent Magazine  (1978)](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/a-cautious-case-for-socialism/). Arrow offers a careful analysis of capitalism and socialism; and doesn't ask you to join a camp.
2. Commencement address at St. John's College, Santa Fe; Boojums all the way through: communicating science in a prosaic age; N. David Mermin; [Cambridge University Press (1990)](https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/physics/history-philosophy-and-foundations-physics/boojums-all-way-through-communicating-science-prosaic-age?format=PB). On how scientific methods help us to make sense of the world.
3. Manifold Destiny; Sylvia Nasar, David Gruber; [The New Yorker (2006)](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/08/28/manifold-destiny). Story of an unusual mathematician, Grigory Perelman. Probably the best profile that I've read in The New Yorker.
4. The Luxury of Introspection; Raghavendra Gadagkar; [Book chapter (2012)](https://eprints.iisc.ac.in/68318/). On how to think as an independent scientist.
5. Grandmother elephants; Eve Marder; [eLife (2013)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01140). In Science, is it fruitful to learn from the older generation when we have access to better instruments for studying nature?
6. You’re probably using the wrong dictionary; James Somers, [His blog (2014)](https://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary). An ode to [Webster’s 1913 dictionary](https://www.websters1913.com/)
7. The Myth and Magic of Generating New Ideas; Dan Rockmore; [The New Yorker (2019)](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-myth-and-magic-of-generating-new-ideas). Research ideas are difficult to conceive; Rockmore tells about what works for him.
8. America Is Not Ready for Omicron; Ed Yong; [The Atlantic (2021)](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/12/america-omicron-variant-surge-booster/621027/). Ed Yong shows once again that one can write a good essay only when they deeply care about the topic.
9. The deracination of literature; Mary Gaitskill; [Unheard (2022)](https://unherd.com/2022/06/the-death-of-literature/) Why read fiction? And does good writing matter?
10. On Killing Charles Dickens; Zadie Smith; [The New Yorker (2023)](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/10/on-killing-charles-dickens).Zadie Smith tries—and fails—to ignore Dickens while writing a nineteenth-century historical fiction.
