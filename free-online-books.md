## General

In case you didn't know, [Zotero 7 (beta version)](https://www.zotero.org/support/beta_builds) includes native readers for HTML and Epub files! One issue I've always had with epub books is a lack of suitable software for reading them on computers (yes, I know about Calibre). Zotero 7 elegantly solved the problem.

- [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
- [archive.org](https://archive.org/) Two rather obvious entries, but the more I explore them, the more I get pleasantly surprised. They are true treasure troves.
