## Addons for Mozilla Firefox

1. [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) is an essential ad blocker. If you're adventurous, it even lets you disable all javascript on a website and remove ad banners or similar elements (Twitter's trending box, for example).
2. [Privacy Badger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/) is not an ad-blocker, but it does something [very clever](https://privacybadger.org/#What-is-Privacy-Badger).
3. The [Zotero connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) allows you to add papers to your Zotero Library. It can also automatically redirect journal webpages through an institutional proxy, allowing you to download papers with your institutional credentials.
4. [Return YouTube dislikes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/return-youtube-dislikes/) brings back a useful feature.
5. [Single-file](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file/) is a neat add-on that can download a webpage with everything, including figures, in a *single* HTML file. Very useful if you want to locally archive, for example, a blog post or a Twitter thread.
6. [Tabliss](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabliss/) sets the new tab page.
7. [Tranquility Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tranquility-1/) converts any webpage with an article to a simple one with only the article's text and core images so that you can read it without 1000 flashy things annoying you.
8. [Feedbro](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/feedbroreader/) helps to get articles from any website that provides an RSS feed (blogs, journals, magazinesâ€¦). A good alternative to Feedly.
9. [Gesturefy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gesturefy/) is such a neat add-on! It lets you do several things, like going back to the previous webpage, only with gestures of your mouse.
10. You open a webpage like [Cosma Shalizi's](http://bactra.org) (check it!) and find hundreds of links. Which one is active and which one is dead? [Link analyzer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-analyzer/) does that job for you with one click.
11. [Hide Youtube-Shorts](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-youtube-shorts/) removes YouTube shorts from its homepage, subscriptions page, and search results. It can also hide the "Shorts" tab. Good riddance!
12. [Control Panel for Twitter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/control-panel-for-twitter/) can edit/remove/add elements of Twitter homepage to create a much better user interface.
