# Some articles I liked

I curated these without a specific theme. I find them well-written; informative and compelling; some are even moving. Chronologically ordered.

2. Commencement address at St. John's College, Santa Fe; Boojums all the way through: communicating science in a prosaic age; N.

4. Manifold Destiny; Sylvia Nasar, David Gruber; [The New Yorker (2006)](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/08/28/manifold-destiny). Story of an unusual mathematician, Grigory Perelman. One of the best profiles that I've read in The New Yorker.
