# Well-written books on science and scientists

I [asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/arghya_dutta_/status/1679955697289576448) which books people like for clarity and prose; many generously shared their favorites. As the Twitter thread quickly became a maze, I collected them here and, if available, added *links to Open Library—where you can borrow and read quite a few of them for free*! I will update the list as more suggestions come in. Thanks to all who shared their favorites.

A [helpful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP1Wleu3Njs) by Meghan Adrian on how Open Library works and how you can browse and, if available, borrow books.

Note: I will keep adding books that I find well-written to this list. (2024-02-24, Saturday)
