# Well-written books on science and scientists

I [asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/arghya_dutta_/status/1679955697289576448) which books people like for clarity and prose; many generously shared their favorites. As the thread quickly became a maze, I collected them here and, if available, added *links to Open Library—where you can borrow and read many of them for free*! I will update the list as more suggestions come in. (Last updated: 2023-07-15, Saturday)
