# YouTube playlists

A curated list of excellent math/science/writing classes or lecture series that I found on YouTube. I enjoyed learning from them. It started from one of my [Twitter threads](https://twitter.com/arghya_dutta_/status/1662196636448182273).

- [Physical Biology of the Cell (Winter 2022) by Rob Phillips](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVA3Onuu1UMA49qoAoHosMTQeZjUy2OeD). Genuinely inspiring.
- [Molecular Biophysics by Erik Lindahl](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuIpgNT2hMwRQKFy4okoNQKiJwM8li3Sz). Lots of insider knowledge on biophysical systems.
- [Deep Learning by Frank Noe](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqPI2gxxYgMKN5AVcTajQ79BTV4BiFN_0). Leisurely paced, meticulous.
- [Writing in the Sciences by Kristin Sainani](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGNyy-rO8GoM7uUxVfYJbccEO8eNFfr1M). If you're starting to write scientific prose, watch the series. Seriously.
- [Foundations of Quantum Mechanics by Florian Marquardt](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLemsnf33Vij6fbgJvFsm_ipMiFHxS4_kw). Fun slides on an intriguing topic.
- [Introduction to Neuroscience by Bing Wen Brunton](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqgZEQsU_8E0l1P9bKR6yKOKPMpoJ_tLR)
- [Useful short guides from ERC on proposal writing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtv6FnsXqnXAYRk6HCErwMxwML0ZKoMcy)
- Roman Vershynin has two neat series on probability theory: [Undergraduate Probability](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPjEEUWIWhQVCnBNkMAc4xxCXSILJDJKl) and [High-Dimensional Probability](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPjEEUWIWhQV7X6dXfrVP3w0KBBLBVJ0j). He teaches with such care and patience!
- [Singular Value Decomposition by Steven Brunton](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNSVjnsviglFoY2nXildDCcv). Delightful variations on a theme. Exceptionally clear.
- I think adding videos *on* scientists to this list makes sense. Here is a series where [Rob Phillips is interviewed by David Zierler for the Caltech Heritage project](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJpNowxCdwLUoIXuC85SVpbNYWrLmokS_). Inspiring and bold!
- Another really great series on [Foundations of Quantum Mechanics. This one is by Rob Spekkens.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaNkJORnlhZk9TDBIFJ49iQ2_f4PBzaS5)
- A very well-produced set of [tutorials on PyMOL from Molecular Memory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMhYZpMLtal_Z7to3by2ATHP-cI4ma5X).
- [A useful introduction to Proteomics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM15vX8cRRl9coSaCNVwcX0DHafWhMJ-M). Great for non-biologists.
- [A short series on asymptotic notation and analysis of algorithms by David Scot Taylor](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSVu1-lON6Lwr2u_VtLcAxtVAZge9sttL). Check his YouTube channel for more stuff: Algorithms with Attitude
- [An introductory biophysics by Ali Hassanali](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp0hSY2uBeP_giW4Rmy9MZ_qryA_NSMTT). Well-organized lectures.
- [Non-equilibrium Statistical Mechanics by V. S. Balakrishnan](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1hbqINXWn51l16bXUQEn4ZZ5jqMKzdMT). Meticulous lectures covering a lot of topics.
- [Machine learning course by Yaser Abu-Mostafa](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD63A284B7615313A). Especially useful for its introductory discussion on learnability and VC dimension.
- [A playlist with an extended interview of an intriguing academic: Freeman Dyson](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVV0r6CmEsFzDA6mtmKQEgWfcIu49J4nN). Really interesting!
- [A playlist with excellent introductory lectures on statistical mechanics by John Preskill](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0ojjrEqIyPzgJUUW76koGcSCy6OGtDRI)
