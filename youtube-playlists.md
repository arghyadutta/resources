# YouTube playlists

A curated list of excellent math/science/writing classes or lecture series that I found on YouTube. I enjoyed learning from them. It started from one of my [Twitter threads](https://twitter.com/arghya_dutta_/status/1662196636448182273).

## Academic guide

- [Useful short guides from ERC on proposal writing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtv6FnsXqnXAYRk6HCErwMxwML0ZKoMcy)

## Academicians

- I think adding videos *on* scientists to this list makes sense. Here is a series where [Rob Phillips is interviewed by David Zierler for the Caltech Heritage project](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJpNowxCdwLUoIXuC85SVpbNYWrLmokS_). Inspiring and bold!
- [A playlist with an extended interview of an intriguing academic: Freeman Dyson](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVV0r6CmEsFzDA6mtmKQEgWfcIu49J4nN). Really interesting!

## Biophysics

- [Physical Biology of the Cell (Winter 2022) by Rob Phillips](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVA3Onuu1UMA49qoAoHosMTQeZjUy2OeD). Genuinely inspiring.
- [Molecular Biophysics by Erik Lindahl](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuIpgNT2hMwRQKFy4okoNQKiJwM8li3Sz). Lots of insider knowledge on biophysical systems.
- [Introduction to Neuroscience by Bing Wen Brunton](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqgZEQsU_8E0l1P9bKR6yKOKPMpoJ_tLR)
- A very well-produced set of [tutorials on PyMOL from Molecular Memory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUMhYZpMLtal_Z7to3by2ATHP-cI4ma5X).
- [A useful introduction to Proteomics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM15vX8cRRl9coSaCNVwcX0DHafWhMJ-M). Great for non-biologists.
- [An introductory biophysics by Ali Hassanali](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp0hSY2uBeP_giW4Rmy9MZ_qryA_NSMTT). Well-organized lectures.

## Computer science

- [Introduction to parallel Programming in Open MP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ5C_6qdAvBFMAko9JTyDJDIt1W48Sxmg) NPTEL course by Yogish Sabharwal from IIT Delhi
- [A short series on asymptotic notation and analysis of algorithms by David Scot Taylor](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSVu1-lON6Lwr2u_VtLcAxtVAZge9sttL). Check his YouTube channel for more stuff: Algorithms with Attitude

## Philosophy

- [Karl Popper - Science: Conjectures and Refutations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8Nxd4OXpzqlbV-ZBu4VfKHRtThzEL7Pf) by Victor Gijsbers. He is a good teacher. Check his channel for more, e.g. epistemology.

## Quantum mechanics

- [Foundations of Quantum Mechanics by Florian Marquardt](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLemsnf33Vij6fbgJvFsm_ipMiFHxS4_kw). Fun slides on an intriguing topic.
- Another really great series on [Foundations of Quantum Mechanics. This one is by Rob Spekkens.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaNkJORnlhZk9TDBIFJ49iQ2_f4PBzaS5)
- [Lectures on Quantum Computing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cl2VeMbE330GKLkYIE8UBrrYdp8L9mR). It's very much worth watching despite the poor recording quality.
- [Introduction to Quantum Information Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkespgaZN4gmu0nWNmfMflVRqw0VPkCGH) by Artur Ekert. Ekert is a patient teacher. The [accompanying free book](https://qubit.guide/) is useful, too.

## Statistical mechanics

- [Non-equilibrium Statistical Mechanics by V. S. Balakrishnan](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1hbqINXWn51l16bXUQEn4ZZ5jqMKzdMT). Meticulous lectures covering a lot of topics.
- [A playlist with excellent introductory lectures on statistical mechanics by John Preskill](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0ojjrEqIyPzgJUUW76koGcSCy6OGtDRI)

## Statistics and Machine learning

- [Deep Learning by Frank Noe](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqPI2gxxYgMKN5AVcTajQ79BTV4BiFN_0). Leisurely paced, meticulous.
- Roman Vershynin has two neat series on probability theory:
  - [Undergraduate Probability](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPjEEUWIWhQVCnBNkMAc4xxCXSILJDJKl) and
  - [High-Dimensional Probability](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPjEEUWIWhQV7X6dXfrVP3w0KBBLBVJ0j). He teaches with such care and patience!
- [Singular Value Decomposition by Steven Brunton](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNSVjnsviglFoY2nXildDCcv). Delightful variations on a theme. Exceptionally clear.
- [Machine learning course by Yaser Abu-Mostafa](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD63A284B7615313A). Especially useful for its introductory discussion on learnability and VC dimension.

## Writing

- [Writing in the Sciences by Kristin Sainani](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGNyy-rO8GoM7uUxVfYJbccEO8eNFfr1M). If you're starting to write scientific prose, watch the series. Seriously.
- [The Writer's workshop](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJicmE8fK0Eib5y-bh4RVFvg492OIwpg8). Short guides from Ted-Ed.
- [Writing Styleâ€”An Online Guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCE15C7599ED6147B). Good solid introduction to English grammar and writing beyond simple definitions. I got to know about this [nice book on rhetorical grammar](https://books.google.de/books/about/Rhetorical_Grammar.html?id=N9WgBwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) from these lectures.
- [Grammar and Stylistics: Writing Clearly](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SrPtYzGjMaMWrybapwijWDquLv89oNT) by Randall Eggert from University of Utah. Excellent! See, for example, the one on [tense and aspect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b39OCT-KUk&list=PL2SrPtYzGjMaMWrybapwijWDquLv89oNT&index=24).
